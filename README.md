# Sign-Language-Interpreter

With the increasing years it has been observed that the number of deaf people being born are increasing steadily, hence it is getting really hard for other people to comprehend the signs these people use to communicate. The main aim here is to devise a solution for both; people who use sign language as well as who communicate with text/ audio making communication between them to be easier.

Run the signDetect.py file for just detection feature or index.py file after configuring with firebase.
